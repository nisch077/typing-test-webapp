1. Text Handling and Variety:

Multiple Text Sources:
Predefined Arrays: Instead of a single array of words, create multiple arrays with varying difficulty 
(e.g., short common words, longer words, sentences with punctuation). Allow the user to select a text source.
Random Sentence Generation (Basic): You could create logic to randomly pick words from a larger vocabulary to form sentences. 
This would provide more unique tests.
Fetching Text from an API (More Advanced): Integrate with a public API that provides random quotes or text snippets. 
This requires making asynchronous requests using fetch().
Word Highlighting: Clearly highlight the current word the user should be typing. You've already started this with the .current class, 
but ensure the JavaScript logic correctly applies and updates this as the user progresses.
Backspacing Logic: Handle backspaces correctly. When a user presses backspace, it should remove the last typed character 
and update the styling (correct/incorrect highlighting) accordingly.
Ignoring Extra Spaces: Decide how you want to handle extra spaces typed by the user. 
You might want to ignore them when calculating accuracy or treat them as errors.

2. Timing and Scoring Enhancements:

Test Duration Options: Allow users to select a test duration (e.g., 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 60 seconds). 
Adjust the timer and end the test automatically after the selected time.
Stop on First Error (Optional Mode): Implement a mode where the test ends as soon as the user makes their first mistake. 
This can be a challenging option.
Character-Level Accuracy: Currently, you're calculating overall accuracy. 
You could provide more granular feedback, perhaps highlighting specific incorrect characters within words in the results.
Adjusted WPM Calculation: Consider different methods for WPM calculation, such as including or excluding errors. 
You might want to offer different WPM metrics.

3. User Feedback and Experience:

Visual Feedback for Correct/Incorrect Input: You've already implemented color changes. 
You could add subtle animations or more distinct visual cues when a character is typed correctly or incorrectly.
Progress Bar: Display a progress bar indicating how much of the text the user has completed.
End-of-Test Summary: Provide a more detailed summary at the end, including:
Raw WPM (total characters typed / 5 / time).
Net WPM (raw WPM - errors / time).
Number of correct words.
Number of incorrect words.
Number of correct characters.
Number of incorrect characters.
Restart Options: Offer options to restart with the same text or a new text.

4. Settings and Customization (Basic Front-End):

Theme Selection (Light/Dark): Allow users to toggle between light and dark themes by dynamically changing CSS classes using JavaScript.
Font Size Adjustment: Provide options to increase or decrease the font size of the text.

5. Accessibility Considerations:

Keyboard Navigation: Ensure the typing input field is always focused or easily focusable using keyboard navigation (Tab key).
Screen Reader Compatibility: Use semantic HTML elements and ARIA attributes to make the typing test accessible to screen readers. 
For example, use appropriate labels for the input field and provide feedback on typing status.
